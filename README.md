# COVID-19 Misinformation Bot

Twitter bot created by students at the University of Western Ontario, aiming to find and correct fake news on the platform related to COVID-19.

## Branches

Please use your own personal branches in the repo for your personal/local work. Once your work is done you can create a PR from that branch to develop.

## Compiling the Code

We have created a Makefile which runs a g++ command to compile all the files and libraries necessary. Usage is defined below:

```bash
make
```

or

```bash
g++ **All .cpp and .h created by devs** -ltwitcurl
```

## Raspberry Pi

To work on the live code/folders on the pi the credentials are the following:

```bash
IP ADDRESS: 10.0.0.110
Username: pi
Password: Ask Someone on the team
```

In the documents folder, there are 2 folders which contain code, "3307 Project" and "3307 Project TEST". The first one contains all the live code and will be updated every time a phase is submitted.

**Any Changes for testing on the PI must be made the test folder!!!!**
